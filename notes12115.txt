Morning notes 1-21-15
							remember to always have enough returns to pass valus back to the original function. 
							Otherwise you may get a undefined value


	Questions asked:
	1. some & each
		Some will stop the first time a value returns true.
		each with interate of all of the values	
	
	2. step by step
	3. map vs each
	4.  Math.round(sqrt) == Math.sqrt(77) using to compare floating numbers to a rounder number, and check if 


Object Oriented Programming:
	constructor function = blueprint to create a bunch of new objects, with the same 'keys'
	

		// these are properties //	
function People(name, age, favFood){
	this.name = name;  //this.name is a property, = name is the array item
	this.age  = age;  // this.age refers to the function that called it
	this.favFood = favFood;
}


AfterNoon Notes:

		Chia is na expectation libary that works with Mocha's testing library:

	Testing: TDD describe what your code is going to do, i.e. thsi function will do this and I expect this
			start with failing, and write the minimum code to pass the test



// defines new CLASS, call Vehicle, used for repeatabilty, and reusing the parameters that you defined //
function Vehicle(model, year) {
	this.model = model;
	this.year = year;
}

//accessible function for the CLASS of Vehicle //
Vehicle.prototype.honk	= function(){
alert("BEEP!");
};
// defines new CLASS, called Car //
function Car(model, year){
	this.model = model;
	this.year = year;
}
// this is prototype inheritance, this will pass along all the prototype's to car from the vehicle CLASS //
Car.prototype = new Vehicle();
