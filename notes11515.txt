git push 

git pull 
git remote add origin some_url


git remote add upstream some_url
	to clone some code as an upstream
git pull upstream master
	pulls new code form a updated repo
	git pull will overwrite any files that you ohave not commit'd, 
if they have the same name.

installing  software using npm, needs sudo to install globally - the -g makes it global

a method is a function that requiers a object, i.e.  sumFunction(a, b);
					--- this needs a & b to be entered to correctly execute.
pop:		removes the last item in an array and returns it to you, permently removing it form the array
push: 		adds an item to the last posistion in an array

shift: 		removes the first item in an array and returns that value to you, permently removing it from the array
unshift:  	adds an item to the beginning of an array 


indexOf(a); 	will return the index (starting with 0) of the inputed argument, if the agument is not present 	
		than it will return a -1, which can than be used to pass or fail a check it something is in an
		array or note

a = 4		this would make a now equal 4, used in decaring varibles.

4 == "4" 	would return TRUE, as it will coerce (coercion); the "4" to a #4 
		and than check those values (it will not change that "4");
4 === "4"	Would return false, as the type of the value is not the same, a string and a integer can not be the same.	

callbacks:	is a function passed to another function. below is an example:

		function add(a, b)  {return a + b;};	
		function sub(a, b ) {return a - b;};
		function mul(a, b)  {return a * b;};
		function div(a, b)  {return a / b;};
		function miniMath (a, b, callback) {return callback(a, b);};



		miniMath(2, 2, add)
		4
		miniMath(2, 2, sub)
		0
		miniMath(2, 2, div)
		1
		miniMath(2, 2, mul)
		4

Afternoon notes:
	DOM - document object model	
	this is where you source html is put after processing, 
	and where javascript interacts with your web page.
I asked if the webkit animations are based of of java, they are not

interacting with the html needs to use somethign like = document.getElementsByTagName("li");
							this targets all the li items on the page.

.adEventListener - common events;	 click, mousedown, and mouseUp
					mouseover, mouseout, and mouseMove
					keydown, keyPress, keyUp
					sumbit, loamouseover, mouseout, and mouseMove
					keydown, keyPress, keyUp
					sumbit, load
event.target.***.*** when located with in a function with erfere to the item that caused the event;
