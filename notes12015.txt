Morning Objects: By Alex
	Understand the philosophy/ "the why" of testing
	
	See how codewars test your code/problem solution

	Set up your JS test environment


TDD = Test Driven Development

	Begin by writing a failing test
		write code to pass the test
		refactor code to be clear and concise, for easy updatable code


TDD requires you to clarify you objecvtives & overall requirements



module.exports; sort of take the code we wrote so that it's availible in our TDD envirn


describe() = just wraps you content & text together and what will show up
it() = the check function that passes or fails the test, show's in green if passed, red if failed


Afternoon: by Tim - functional programming

		iterators are helper methods to use instead of FOR loops
		
	forEach	: Instead of using a 'FOR' loop to go through and do somethign, 
		  no counters needed, just does on each element that it's passed

		  var friends =["Peter", "Tim", "Alex", "Myla", "Elie"]
	          friends.forEach(function(buddy){ console.log("Hello, " + buddy + "!"); 
				This would log to the console, "Hello, someFriend!"

	map	: this returnd a new array based on what you did in the body of the function
		  allows us to run though an array and declare some functions and create a new array with that info

	filter	: this "filters" or removes items form an array and outputs a new array with whats left;
		  this leave the old array intact, and creats a new array:
		
	
	reduce	:
	some	:
	every	:

Methods
Interators


need to cover
the writing of the TDD
need a big break with Tim;


to much time on the code walk throughs: maybe th ability to look over the code by pre-selecting people to prezentation
before hand, and not randomly 

fridays shorter reviews, people are itchin to work on the weekend project

maybe mini exercises each night on what will be worked on the next day, to help drive the lecture
