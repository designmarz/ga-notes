2-17-15 Notes:
	Better Code with OOP

Model 	----> deal with the HTML & database
View	----> maintain state
Controller -> deals with connecting the MODEL & VIEW together

need a models directory
need to require in header of app.rb

----->	require_relative './models/someModel' -----> no need for the file extension

i.e. root/models/someModel.rb

Class Methods:

define as a class, which is a template for a somethign Model.

	class Squad	----->
		def self.conn= connection -----> a setter method, required for @conn to pick up connection
			@conn = connection
		def self.all -----> 
	squads = []
		
		@conn.exec("SELECT * FROM squads")
		end
	end




----->----->----->----->----->

class Greater
  def.self.greet
    "Hellow World, #{@name}"
   end

  def.self.name- name
	@name = name
  end
end


Greeter.greet -----> would output
"Hello World, "

Greeter.name = "Nick" -----> assigns the def.self.name to "Nick"

Gretter.greet -----> now outputs

"Hello World, Nick"

----->----->----->----->----->

CLASS Constructor in RUBY:
	        <this is ruby's keyword>	
			^
    class Student	
	def initialize first, last
		@first = first
		@last - last
	end

	def first
		@first
	end
	
	def last
		@last
	end
	
	def first= first
		@first = first
	end

	def last= last
		@last = last
	end
end
